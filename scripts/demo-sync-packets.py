"""Count the sync checksums recorded in a demo (.sdfz).

The engine compares its own checksums only against the ones a demo carries,
and logs nothing when they match. A demo with none would replay "clean"
whatever the simulation did, so scripts/replay-check.sh refuses one, and
requires playback to reach the last frame that has a checksum.

Prints: <number of NETMSG_SYNCRESPONSE packets> <last frame that has one>
